    "text": "I am a 3rd year at the University of California, Santa Barbara and majoring in environmental studies. After UCSB, I aim to go to grad school and get a masters’ degree in environmental engineering.\nAfter taking AP Environmental Science in high school, I grew passionate about the environment and climate change. I think it is important for this generation to fix what the older generations have done to this planet in regards to greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and environmental injustice. However, in this age of digitization and social media, I think it is also important that we hold ourselves accountable now that we can buy $300 worth of fast fashion at our fingertips.\nIn terms of grad school, I have always been drawn to engineering in some way ever since my grade school counselors told me I should go into it because of “my math scores.” I think it’s appropriate to combine what I’ve been drawn to as a kid and my passion for my master’s degree.\nAs a person, I’m a 20 year old LA native who’s just trying to navigate through life. Born to a Japanese father and a Mexican mother, I would say that there have been many bumps along the road not just being a person of color, but also as a woman. As a woman of color in STEM, I am very thankful for all the opportunities I have been privileged to get, including a good education as well as support from my loved ones."

    "text": "My favorite hobby is definitely dancing. I have been dancing since I was 5 years old and went to a dance studio from ages 5 - 11. It has been one of my passions for a very long time, but I do not have the time to do classes anymore, so I just dance on my own when I can. Unfortunately, that has resulted in me being a little rusty regarding technique.\nAnother one of my favorite things to do is listen to music. Some of my favorite artists include NCT, ENHYPEN, Lana Del Rey, Chase Atlantic, and Harry Styles. If I could, I would spend all my time listening to music, but I’m think that wouldn’t be good for my ears.\nOther hobbies that I’m sure many others have include eating and sleeping. As a college student, there is nothing like comfort food and getting more than 6 hours of sleep. Some of my comfort foods include bibimbap (a Korean rice dish), takoyaki (Japanese octopus snack - typical street food in Japan), and bubble tea."
