I am a 3rd year at the University of California, Santa Barbara and majoring in environmental studies. After UCSB, I aim to go to grad school and get a masters' degree in environmental engineering.

As a woman of color in STEM, I am very thankful for all the opportunities I have been privileged to get, including a good education as well as support from my loved ones.
