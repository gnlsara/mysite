My favorite hobby is definitely dancing. I have been dancing since I was 5 years old and went to a dance studio from ages 5 - 11. It has been one of my passions for a very long time, but I do not have the time to do classes anymore, so I just dance on my own when I can. Unfortunately, that has resulted in me being a little rusty regarding technique.

Another one of my favorite things to do is listen to music. Some of my favorite artists include NCT, ENHYPEN, Lana Del Rey, Chase Atlantic, and Harry Styles. If I could, I would spend all my time listening to music, but I'm think that wouldn't be good for my ears.

Other hobbies that I'm sure many others have include eating and sleeping. As a college student, there is nothing like comfort food and getting more than 6 hours of sleep. Some of my comfort foods include bibimbap (a Korean rice dish), takoyaki (Japanese octopus snack - typical street food in Japan), and bubble tea.
